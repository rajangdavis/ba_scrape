In addition, the decoction brewing process lends much depth and richness of flavor. Little to no hop aroma is detectable; the nose is dominated by malty notes of bread, nuts, and perhaps a touch of chocolate. Hop varieties used tend to be German Noble varieties like Tettnanger and Hallertau. Bitterness is often moderate, with just enough to balance out any sweetness.

They should be decanted properly, leaving the yeast in the bottle. This will showcase their brilliant color range from pale straw yellow to various amber hues. Most will be crowned with thick, clinging, rocky white heads. Flavors and aromas will vary. Some have natural spice character contributed by yeast and hops, while others are deliberately spiced.

Traditionally, Tripels are bright yellow to deep gold in color, a shade or two darker than the average Pilsener. The head should be big, dense, and creamy. Expect a complex aroma and flavor: spicy phenols, powdery yeast, and fruity esters with a sweet finish. Sweetness comes from both the pale malts and the higher alcohol. Bitterness is up there for a strong beer with such a light body, but it can be hard to perceive in well balanced versions. The lighter body comes from the use of Belgian candi sugar (up to 25 percent sucrose), which not only lightens the body, but also adds various alcoholic aromas and flavors. Small amounts of spices are sometimes added as well.

In general, the style's dark brown color covered up cloudiness and the smoky, roasted brown malts and bitter tastes masked brewing imperfections. Historically, the addition of stale ale also lent a pleasant acidic flavor to the style, which made it quite popular.

These beers are incredible when pairing. Bitterness, alcohol and residual sugar are very low, allowing the beer’s acidity, white bread and graham cracker malt flavors to shine.

This method dates back to the late 1800's in California when refrigeration was a great luxury. At the time, brewers had to improvise to cool the beer down, so shallow fermenters were used. In a way, the lager yeast was trained to ferment quicker at warmer temperatures. Today's examples are light amber to tawny red in color, medium bodied, and possess a malty character. Some mildly fruitiness along with an herbal yet assertive hop bitterness are also typical.

This is a light- to medium-bodied ale, with a low malt aroma that has a spiced and sometimes fruity-ester character. Sugar is sometimes added to lighten the perceived body. This style is medium in sweetness and not as bitter as Belgian-style tripels or golden strong ales. It is usually brilliantly clear. The overall impression is balance between light sweetness, spice and low to medium fruity ester flavors.","abvRange":"6.3–7.9%","ibuRange":"15–30","glassware":"Tulip"},{"name":"Japanese Rice Lager","baLink":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/styles/169/","description":"Pale yellow in color with a soft hop nose, Japanese Rice Lagers often have a rounded, firm malty character with moderate bitterness and a trademark dry finish. Similar to American Adjunct Lagers, the beer's grist bill is cut by using large portions of rice, but not enough to be classified as Happoshu, a \"sparkling beverage\" with a malt content of less than two-thirds.

These beers may be oak-aged and sometimes have small amounts of darker malts added.","abvRange":"8.5–12.2%","ibuRange":"45–85","glassware":"Snifter"},{"name":"German Eisbock","baLink":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/styles/36/","description":"Eisbock is an extremely strong beer with a typical alcohol content well beyond 7 percent ABV. This beer undergoes a freezing process called “freeze distilling” that separates water from the other components (alcohol and sugars) to concentrate these. Because water has a lower freezing point than ethanol, the water freezes, leaving the alcohol liquid. When the water ice is removed, the remaining beer is stronger than before. Eisbock can range from near black to as light as tawny red. Hop bitterness and flavor are mostly cast aside with a big alcohol presence replacing it, which can range from sweet to spicy, and fruity to fusel. Look for a heavy or almost syrupy body with tons of malty flavor.","abvRange":"7.0-14.0%","ibuRange":"25-35","glassware":"Snifter"},{"name":"English Pale Mild Ale","baLink":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/styles/76/","description":"Similar in many ways to an ordinary Bitter, yet not as hoppy, the English Pale Mild Ale is a delicate, malt-forward brew. Lighter in color than Dark Milds, this style ranges from a pale amber to a deep amber or even an amber brown. Fruitiness, sulfur, and buttery diacetyl may be present in the nose, while hops—traditionally English in origin—are generally subdued yet offer a balancing bitterness. The low alcohol range makes this type of ale a perfect session beer. Not as popular as it has been in the past, Pale Mild is nonetheless an ale for those who appreciate nuance and a bit of history in their pint glass.

Other herbs, spices, and berries might be used to create interesting and pleasant aromas and flavors of green and herbal teas.

As a result, there are very few \"all malt\" malt liquors. Hops are used sparingly, just enough bitterness to balance off any cloyingness. Higher alcohol versions tend to have loads of fusel alcohol, which gives off solvent or fuel-like aromas and flavors. They are highly attenuated, meaning a higher ratio of fermentable sugars are present compared to some other beers, allowing the brewer to achieve a high alcohol content without using as many ingredients. Some breweries enable the use of special enzymes to further break down the malt and adjuncts so they will yield a higher percentage of alcohol. This makes for quite a dry beer, with only a small amount of unfermented sugars and a strong kick from the higher ABV. For the most part, Malt Liquor beers are sold in 40-ounce bottles.

In the US, there is Ice Beer and Malt Liquor, both of which rely on a high amount of rice or corn to lighten the flavor. Many European and Asian breweries also have a strong lager similar to Malt Liquor, although these examples are made with more malt or all malt.

Many taverns would make this blend right at the bar, though brewers would also blend them as well. The ultimate goal is a beverage with perceivable honey and beer qualities (meaning malt, hops and/or yeast) that compliment each other, though not necessarily equally present. Ideally, there should be a balance between the honey character and malt flavor with the hop bitterness not overpowering the sweetness while remaining noticeable.

Pale straw to pale gold, this style is intended to be lighter in color and body than a typical American IPA. For that reason, the mash is often some combination of Pilsner malt, wheat, corn, and/or rice. The addition of an amylase enzyme reduces the final gravity even further. Bitterness is also kept to a minimum. Fruit-forward flavors and aromas are achieved by late hopping, dry hopping, and the use of neutral ale yeast strains. In short, these beers are highly attenuated, late hopped IPAs inspired by the appearance and mouthfeel of Champagne.

Hop bitterness is evident. With US craft brewers doing so much experimentation in beer styles and ingredients, the lines between certain stouts and porters are often blurred.

Pale yellow to deep golden in color, the color tends to darken with age. Younger versions are often cloudy, while older ones are generally clear. The white-colored head generally has poor retention.

It was commonly spiced with pepper, orange peel, and coriander, with spontaneous fermentation by the microbes found in the air. The end result was a light-bodied and gently flavored acidic beer that sometimes had hints of spice. Faro was usually sweetened before packaging or on-premise. Sometimes faro was a blend of aged lambic beer with freshly made low-alcohol Lambic or even a low-alcohol non-Lambic ale.
